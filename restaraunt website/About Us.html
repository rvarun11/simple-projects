    <h3> COMPANY PROFILE </h3> <br>
    <h4>A Global Leader In Hospitality </h4>
    <p>Today, 150,000 people are working together to make Black Swan global leader in hospitality. Through subsidiaries, we own and operate more than 1,500 restaurants and serve more than 320 million meals a year that create many lasting memories for our
      guests. Black Swan is India's entirely glass hilltop fine dining restaurant. Situated atop the Sugarloaf in the Port Hills, it's the ideal place for that very special night out and the best spot in Christchurch to watch the sunset - right from your
      dining table! Dine in the ambient moonlight and enjoy panoramic views of the city lights whilst enjoying the live music from some of the best jazz entertainers the city has to offer.
      <br> Just 35 minutes from the centre of Wave City Center, yet in a world of its own, a night at Black Swan will have you basking in the peaceful and relaxing atmosphere of our hilltop setting. But it's not all about location - here at Blue Moon
      we have forged a reputation as one of New Zealand's top restaurants. We believe in using only the freshest ingredients, the most talented chefs and waiting staff of the most professional standard. Be prepared to be properly taken care of by our
      outstanding staff whilst you enjoy our delicious cuisine. </p>

    <h4> Our Food </h4>
    <p> Here at the Blue Moon we pride ourselves on inspirational cuisine as well as providing a fresh twist on some old favourites. All of our food must meet rigorous requirements which ensure only freshest, cleanest and most delicious morsels reach your
      table. This deep respect for clean, beautiful food has made us four-times winner of New Zealand Gold Elite Cuisine Awards in: 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010.

      <u>Sunrise Breakfast</u>: We are open every morning for breakfast, but the most spectacular sunrise breakfasts happen between the months of May - August. Unfortunately of course, the sunrise is weather dependent.
      <br>
      <u>Sunshine Lunch</u>: Sit in our fantastic outdoor dining area that overlooks the beauty and peace of the Port Hills.
      <br>
      <u>Sunset Dinner</u>: Gorgeous sunset dinners happen all year round, but are of course, weather dependent. You'll also be serenaded by our talented Jazz Band Wednesday to Saturday evenings. These meals are very popular and we recommend booking in
      advance to secure a spot.
